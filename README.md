# emaxx
This repo contains implementation of the most emaxx algorithm implementations on Java.
Current list of implemented algorithms:
## Algebra
### Euclid
    * GCD(a,b) (greatest common division) recursive and iterative O(log min(a,b))
    * Extended Euclidean algorithm: find coefficients of ax+by=gcd(a,b)
    * Diophantine Equation ax+by=c
    * LCM (least common multiplier)
    * Inverse element a^(-1) by modulo m using gcd
    * All inverse elements by modulo m to m O(m)
### Binary multiplication
    * Pow: number^degree by modulo m O(log degree)
    * Multiply: a * b % mod  O(log b)
    * Binary generic operations: solved tasks that could be divided into binary multiplication with their one operator
### Fibonacci
    * Calculates fibonacci numbers by using fast binary calculation and matrix
### Primes
    * Lowest prime divisor for all numbers to n O(n)
## String
### Z-function
    * Least Compression - find cycles
    * Amount of specific substring in current string
### Prefix function
## Graph
### BFS
### DFS
### Diameter and Center of Tree
### Two centers of tree

(http://e-maxx.ru) is very good russian site with a good explanations, analysis and implementations (on C++) of many kinds of algorithms.
Thanks to emaxx for this!
