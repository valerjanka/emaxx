This repo contains implementation of the most emaxx algorithm implementations on Java.
Current list of implemented algorithms:
1. Algebra
1.1 Euclid
    * GCD(a,b) (greatest common division) recursive and iterative O(log min(a,b))
    * Extended Euclidean algorithm: find coefficients of ax+by=gcd(a,b)
    * Diophantine Equation ax+by=c
    * LCM (least common multiplier)
    * Inverse element a^(-1) by modulo m using gcd
    * All inverse elements by modulo m to m O(m)
1.2 Binary multiplication
    * Pow: number^degree by modulo m O(log degree)
    * Multiply: a * b % mod  O(log b)
    * Binary generic operations: solved tasks that could be divided into binary multiplication with their one operator
1.3 Fibonacci - calculates fibonacci numbers by using fast binary calculation and matrix
1.4 Primes
    * Lowest prime divisor for all numbers to n O(n)
2. String
2.1 Z-function
    * Least Compression - find cycles
    * Amount of specific substring in current string
2.2 Prefix function
3. Graph
3.1 BFS
3.2 DFS
3.3 Diameter and Center of Tree
3.4 Two centers of tree

(http://e-maxx.ru) is very good russian site with a good explanations, analysis and implementations (on C++) of many kinds of algorithms.
Thanks to emaxx for this!
